I have been spending a lot of time at Noisebridge. One of their many cool ongoing projects is <a href="https://www.noisebridge.net/wiki/Spacebridge:_The_Next_Generation">Spacebridge</a>, a DIY high altitude balloon group. We are using Meshtastic LoRa telemetry and associated hardware to launch things close to the edge of space with hydrogen balloons. Up to now, the group has been attaching an array of dev boards/modules on protoboard for each launch, leading to some repeatability problems with the electronics and last minute frenzies, so I am working on an open source Spacebridge HAB PCB :)

In this post I will outline the system, cover the development of the board, and explain how to use atopile and kicad to modify it.
