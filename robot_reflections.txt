Session started 2025-07-07.

Reviewed `CUSTOMIZE.md`, `change_log_for_robots.md`, `robot_reflections.md`, and `jekyll_guide_for_robots.md`. The documentation is in good shape and reflects our recent progress on fonts and the gallery layout. The project is ready for the next set of tasks. A minor typo was noted in the `CUSTOMIZE.md` project structure diagram (`robot` vs. `robots`). No other immediate housekeeping issues were found.
