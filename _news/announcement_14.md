Lots of assorted updates.

I am excited to be joining the Frontier Tower Biolab's Neurotech accelerator team as the Platform co-director along with Yoyo! This will be a major evolution in our work on MEAs and headstage design. We will be working with a team of startups to develop a platform for growing, sustaining, and monitoring living 3D functional structures and organoids. This work will be open source and made widely available. We are really excited about what a low cost open-source platform to study living "organoids" could  do for drug research and development.
