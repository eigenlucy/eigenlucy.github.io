I've been quite busy. 

Due to a number of immigration complications, my wife has had to self-deport and cannot reenter the US until we sort out her greencard/O1 situation. I am thus now split between San Francisco, Mexico City, and Montevideo. I hope to be able to return to San Francisco full time very soon. Until then, I will be boucing around quite a lot. This will slow down some of my work quite substantially, but I will try to focus on working through the backlog of project updates and finalize all my old projects. I look forward to our triumphant Napoleonic return from exile.

In other news, Vera has made some incredible progress on her research platform/agent memory system, <a href="sophia-labs.com">Sophia Labs</a>. Check it out and sign up for her demo!

Also check out this geophysical survey simulator we made for a company I've been working on, <a href="mithrasindustrial.com">Mithras Industrial</a>! This project has become my full time gig and primary focus. We will have some exciting updates and hardware demos to show very soon :)
