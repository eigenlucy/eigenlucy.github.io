My second presentation at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IcFa14aXTKQ">Ekkolapto Institute's</a> polymath salon is out! In related news, I pushed major updates to the NonHumanScent kit. It now features 8 BME688 sensors (each containing 8 individual MOX elements), and features an improved layout. Firmware updates incoming, watch the <a href="https://github.com/eigenlucy/nonhumanscent.git">GitHub repo</a> for updates.

I just received the first PCBs for my Spacebridge and WASP projects. Stay tuned for more updates and final releases :)
