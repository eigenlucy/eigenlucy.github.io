In 1854, Victor Hugo began writing an epic poem titled "La Fin de Satan" (The End of Satan). This was one of the most interesting projects Hugo ever worked on, but tragically it was left unfinished. The themes are familiar, but far more metaphyscial and raw, far further from the light of grace than Hugo ever allowed himself to venture in his other pleas for [lost souls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Last_Day_of_a_Condemned_Man). In many ways the story resembles Milton's Paradise Lost, but Hugo's Satan is not a heroic rebel. He is ashamed. He is lonely. For this reason, the grace in this essay is far more potent that the transcendent, patriachal form of redemption offered to Jean. Hugo's compassion for Satan required a total destitution of justice as such, which he planned to culminate in a storming of the Bastille as both a spiritually and religiously revolutionary victory, not a mere succession of rights.

"A great deal of innocence or cunning is needed by a
philosophy of communication that claims to restore the society of
friends, or even of wise men, by forming a universal opinion as
"consensus" able to moralize nations, States, and the markct.!" Hu-
man rights say nothing about the immanent modes of existence of
people provided with rights. Nor is it only in the extreme situations
described by Primo Levi that we experience the shame of being
human. We also experience it in insignificant conditions, before the
meanness and vulgarity of existence that haunts democracies, before
the propagation of these modes of existence and of thought-for-the-
market, and before the values, ideals, and opinions of our time. The
ignominy of the possibilities of life that we are offered appears from
within. We do not feel ourselves outside of our time but continue 10
undergo shameful compromises with it. This feeling of shame is om-
of philosophy's most powerful motifs. We are not responsible lor (he
victims but responsible before them. And there is no way to escape
the ignoble but to play the part of the animal (to growl, burrow,
snigger, distort ourselves): thought itself is sometimes closer to an
animal that dies than to a living, even democratic, human being."
