I am interested in how systems work and how they fail. Electrical engineering is my abiding interest in systems theory meeting a concrete desire to design and build systems. At Kyocera-AVX I have been reverse engineering products to discover novel use cases and problems our products might suit, assessing the viability of production and prototype components in a variety of existing systems, and investigating application areas of interest on behalf of scientists developing products in those spaces.
