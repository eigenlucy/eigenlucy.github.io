I am interested in how systems work and how they fail. Electrical engineering is my top proficiency, following from an abiding interest in systems theory/control theory meeting a passion for building machines. At Kyocera-AVX I have been reverse engineering systems to identify and investigate use cases for our products, assessing our components in a variety of existing systems, and investigating application areas of interest on behalf of product development and R&D teams.
