These are cultures of bioluminescent dinoflagellates plankton made with the help of the nice folks at <a href="https://www.counterculturelabs.org/">Counter Culture Labs</a>.

We made culture media using aquarium salt mix and UPS water, then introduced dinoflagelletes from a variety of sources. After that, they just need a conisistent day light cycle and water changes (roughly every two weeeks).
