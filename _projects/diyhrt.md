Being trans is all about being your own doctor/technician. This page will host my notes and methods on DIY HRT. I've been fully on DIY for about 3 years at this point, and I've collected lots of great resources I wanna share.


My areas of research are:
* DIY gel compounding (t gel and e gel)
* Alternative level measurement techniques
* Small scale manufacturing of E vials

# Basics
* Check out <a href="https://diyhrt.wiki">DIY.HRT</a> wiki for basic info on sourcing, dosage, and testing.
* Check out <a href="https://www.hrt.mom">HRT.MOM</a> for info on homebrewing vials
* <a href="https://www.dragonordnance.com">DragonOrdinance</a> is my preferred site for sourcing raws.

# DIY level monitoring

I have found two promising alternatives to traditional blood tests thus far:
* 1) Urinalysis based fertility monitors. I use a smart device called Inito. There is a camera system that attaches to the back of my phone and test strips that cost a few bucks each. This measures secondary metabolites in urine, and is thus note especially accurate. It's made to be tracking periods, which leads to some annoyances in with the UX. But I have found this reliable gives me a good insight into the state of my levels.
* 2) Saliva based fertility analyzers, namely <a href="https://ovul.ai">Ovul</a>. These are electronic tongue based fertility anlyzers. I have one on the way, and haven't learned much from what's online, but as an enose/etongue research enthusiast I'm pretty exicted about this one. Plus, not needing test strips is killer. Once this gets in, I'll test both systems against bloodwork.


# Gel compounding

Tgel and Egel are very easy to DIY from raws!!


I will post more info on this Soon.


In the meantime, check out this <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20070237822A1/en">patent</a> containing an ingredient list and methods of Tgel

# Vials

## Equipment:
* Dry/Wet sterilizer (I use an Omniclave)
* Vials + vial crimp
* .22uM PTFE filters
* Benzyl Alcohol
* Benzyl Benzoate
* Raws
* MCT or Castor oil
